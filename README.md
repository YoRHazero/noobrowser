## NooBrowser: a web-based application for WFSS data 

This app need to incorporate **NooBackend**. Both this app and backend code is undergoing construction, hence now it is only for internal use :(

Access [here](https://yorhazero.github.io/noobrowser/) to have a try. Or you can run it locally by downloading
the app from [Releases](https://github.com/YoRHazero/noobrowser/tags).

Now backend is running on http://172.16.48.221:8848, function about username is not implemented yet, just ignore it.
